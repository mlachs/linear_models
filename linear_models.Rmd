```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

```


Do some data cleaning 


```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) |> 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |> 
  select(price, stars, borough, neighborhood, room_type) %>% 
  mutate(borough = fct_infreq(borough),
         room_type = fct_infreq(room_type))
```

## Fit some models

Start simpple

```{r}

fit = lm(price ~ stars, data = nyc_airbnb)

summary(fit)

names(fit)


coef(fit)

broom::tidy(fit)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term,estimate, p.value)

fit %>% 
  broom::glance()


```

TRy a bit more complex

```{r}
fit= 
  lm(price~ stars+borough, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term,estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(
    term = str_replace(term, "borough",'Borough: ')
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
